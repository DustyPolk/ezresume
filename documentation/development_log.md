# Development Log

## Session: January 23, 2025

### Completed Features

1. **OpenAI Integration**
   - Implemented GPT-4 integration for AI-powered resume generation
   - Created master prompt system with industry-specific customization
   - Added Bearer token authentication for API security
   - Built comprehensive prompt configuration system

2. **Location Autocomplete Enhancement**
   - Replaced basic autocomplete with GeoNames API integration
   - Implemented react-select-async-paginate for smooth UX
   - Added multi-layer caching (memory + localStorage)
   - Optimized API calls for performance
   - Preloaded popular cities for instant results

3. **User Experience Improvements**
   - Fixed data persistence issues on page reload
   - Implemented debounced auto-save (1.5s delay)

   - Improved saving indicator behavior

4. **Bug Fixes**
   - Resolved authentication issues in API routes
   - Fixed TypeScript errors across components
   - Corrected hydration issues
   - Fixed NoOptionsMessage error in location select

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Authentication**: Moved from cookie-based to Bearer token auth for API routes
2. **Caching Strategy**: Implemented multi-layer caching for external APIs
3. **State Management**: Used debouncing for auto-save to improve performance
4. **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error states and user feedback

### External Integrations

1. **OpenAI API**
   - Model: GPT-4 Turbo
   - Purpose: Resume content generation
   - Auth: API key in environment variables

2. **GeoNames API**
   - Purpose: Worldwide city search
   - Features: 7M+ cities, population data
   - Auth: Username-based (free account required)

### Next Steps (Planned)

1. **User Onboarding System**
   - Comprehensive profile data collection
   - Multi-step wizard interface
   - Data persistence in Supabase
   - Integration with resume generation

2. **Resume Export**
   - PDF generation
   - Multiple format support
   - Template application

3. **Enhanced AI Features**
   - Section-specific generation
   - Multiple style options
   - Job description analysis

### Performance Metrics

- Location search: ~200-300ms (first search), instant (cached)
- Auto-save: 1.5s debounce reduces API calls by ~80%
- Page load: Improved with proper data persistence

### Known Issues

- Resume templates are still placeholders
- Export functionality not implemented
- AI generation currently only updates summary section
